# Movie Recommendation System

A simple movie recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering based on user similarity on a large dataset. The system allows users to rate movies (either from top movies, by genre, or their favorites) and provides personalized movie recommendations based on similar users' preferences. Built using Python with pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for calculating user similarities. The system uses the MovieLens dataset as its foundation and implements a user-based collaborative filtering approach using cosine similarity to find users with similar taste profiles.

How to run: Change the path of code to the file locations. This dataset goes up to September 2018 but you can change out the csv file with newer movies as GitHub won't let me upload a larger dataset, so visit https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/to get a larger dataset that you can use locally. Also depending on your computer change the sample size because ur computer might blow up if you change the sample size on line 13 to the max so change it to whatever is suitible to your computer.

In the future hopefully i will be able to use a data set from a poplular site such as Imbd
